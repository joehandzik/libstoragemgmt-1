.TH lsmd.conf "5" "January 2015" "lsmd.conf @VERSION@" "libStorageMgmt daemon config"
.SH NAME
lsmd.conf - libStorageMgmt daemon lsmd configuration file.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The libStorageMgmt plugin daemon (\fBlsmd\fR) will read the \fBlsmd.conf\fR
file in the folder defined via \fB--confdir\fR (default is \fB/etc/lsm/\fR).

The daemon reads the plugin configuration files from the sub-folder
\fBpluginconf.d\fR. The plugin configuration file should be named as
<uri_scheme>.conf, for example:

    * MegaRAID plugin (\fBmegaraid\fR://):   \fBmegaraid.conf\fR

The \fBlsmd.conf\fR file controls the global settings for \fBlsmd\fR while
the plugin configuration file for each plugin controls individual plugin behavior.

Each option line of the configuration file should contain a trailing
semicolon(\fB;\fR).

.SH lsmd.conf OPTIONS
.TP
\fBallow-plugin-root-privilege = true;\fR

Indicates whether the \fBlsmd\fR daemon should keep running as root mode and invoke
plugin as root user when needed.

Without this option or with option set as \fBfalse\fR means that the daemon and
the plugins will never run as root.

Only when all the following requirements are met, will \fBlsmd\fR run specified
plugins as root user:

    1. "allow-plugin-root-privilege = true;" in lsmd.conf
    2. "require-root-privilege = true;" in plugin config
    3. API connection (or lsmcli) has root privileges

.SH Plugin OPTIONS
.TP
\fBrequire-root-privilege = true;\fR

Indicates plugin requires root privilege.
Without this line or set as \fBfalse\fR, the plugin will never be invoked as root
user by \fBlsmd\fR.

Please check \fBlsmd.conf\fR option \fBallow-plugin-root-privilege\fR for
detail.
