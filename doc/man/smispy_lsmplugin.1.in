.SH NAME
smispy_lsmplugin -- LibstorageMgmt SMI-S Plugin

.SH DESCRIPTION
LibstorageMgmt SMI-S Plugin allows LibstorageMgmt user to manage storage
arrays like: EMC VNX/VMAX, HDS AMS and LSI MegaRAID etc. via
SNIA SMI-S standard. The 'smispy_lsmplugin' executable file is for
LibstorageMgmt daemon to execute when client user requests SMI-S plugin.

.SH URI
To use this plugin, users should set their URI to this format:
.nf

    # HTTP connection
    \fBsmispy://<username>@<smis_provder_host>:<port>?<uri_parameters>\fR

    # HTTPS connection
    \fBsmispy+ssl://<username>@<smis_provder_host>:<port>?<uri_parameters>\fR

.fi

.TP
\fBusername\fR

The \fBusername\fR is the SMI-S provider user account.

.TP
\fBsmis_provder_host\fR

The \fBsmis_provder_host\fR is the SMI-S provider's IP address or DNS name.

.TP
\fBport\fR

By default, SMI-S plugin will use port \fB5988\fR for HTTP connection and
port \fB5989\fR for HTTPS connection. You can skip this in URI if your
SMI-S provider is using default ports.

For non-default ports, SELinux will likely prevent the SMI-S plugin from making
a network connection.

.TP
\fBURI parameters\fR
These URI parameters are supported by this plugin:

.RS 7
.TP
\fBnamespace=<name_space>\fR
This URI parameter is for LSI MegaRAID and NetApp E-Series only.

.TP
\fBsystem=<system_id>\fR
For those SMI-S providers which support multi-systems(Example EMC ECIM),
this URI parameter can be used to limit network communication for
specified system only. The \fBsystem_id\fR is the ID of the system:
 * \fBlsm.System.id\fR              (Python API)
 * \fBlsm_system_id_get()\fR        (C API)
 * \fBlsmcli list --systems\fR      (lsmcli command line)

.TP
\fBno_ssl_verify=yes\fR
This URI parameter is for HTTPS connections only. With this URI parameter,
the SMI-S plugin will not validate SMI-S provider's server SSL certificate.
It's often used for self-signed CA environment, but it's strongly suggested to
remove this URI parameter and install self-signed CA properly.

.SH Supported Hardware
The LibstorageMgmt SMI-S plugin is based on 'Block Services Package' profile
, SNIA SMI-S 1.4 or later. Any storage system which implements that profile
may be supported. Detailed support status can be queried via:

 * \fBlsm.Client.capabilities()\fR  (Python API)
 * \fBlsm_capabilities()\fR         (C API)
 * \fBlsmcli capabilities\fR        (lsmcli command line).

.SH FIREWALL RULES
By default, this plugin requires access to the SMI-S provider's TCP 5988 port
for HTTP conenction and TCP 5989 port for HTTPS connection.
