.SH NAME
simc_lsmplugin -- LibstorageMgmt Simulator C Plugin

.SH DESCRIPTION
LibStorageMgmt simulator C plugin is for development use. The plugin simulates
an array which supports most features of the library. The simulator is memory
based, state will be discarded once the plugin exits. The 'simc_lsmplugin'
executable file is for the libStorageMgmt daemon to execute when client user
specifies simc plugin in the URI.

Since every command of lsmcli is a standalone libStorageMgmt session, this
plugin is essentially useless for this purpose. In this use case, the
libStorageMgmt simulator plugin \fBsim_lsmplugin(1)\fR is suggested.

This plugin is written in pure C and is intended to be an example of a
C plugin for the library.
