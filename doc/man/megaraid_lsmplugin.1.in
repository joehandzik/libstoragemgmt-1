.SH NAME
megaraid_lsmplugin -- LibstorageMgmt MegaRAID plugin

.SH DESCRIPTION
LibstorageMgmt megaraid plugin allows user to manage LSI MegaRAID via vendor
tool \fBstorcli\fR[1] or Dell PERC via \fBperccli\fR[2].
The 'megaraid_lsmplugin' executable file is for libStorageMgmt
daemon to execute when client user specifies megaraid plugin in the URI.

Extra SELinux actions are required to allowing plugin access the hardware.

When both storcli and percli is installed, the plugin will use storcli
by default even that will result in no system found on Dell PERC server.
In this case, please remove storcli.

Please be noted, current volume ID is just for temperate use, we will change
to use volume VPD83 as volume ID once vendor provide so.
